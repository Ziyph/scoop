This repository is my personal [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) bucket. Here, you'll find software I use that isn't available in Scoop's official buckets.

## Software

Currently, this bucket offers the following software:

- [WinPaletter](https://github.com/Abdelrhman-AK/WinPaletter)
- [masir](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/masir)
